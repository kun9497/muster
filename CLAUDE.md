# muster — working notes for Claude

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-muster-design.md` (English canonical, Korean pair). It is also the
decision log (D01–D28). Read it before changing any contract: facts schema, control ids, exit codes,
waiver keys, output format.

## Build and test

- `go build ./...` (or `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath ./cmd/muster` to match the CI build step) —
  compile everything.
- `make test` — `go test -race ./...` (needs a C toolchain for `-race`; on a host without one, run
  `go test ./...` and rely on CI, which runs on Linux, for the race build).
- `make lint` — `gofmt -l .` then `go vet ./...`.
- `make lint-controls` — `go run ./cmd/muster controls lint`.
- `make fmt` — `gofmt -l -w .` to fix formatting in place.

## Layout

`cmd/muster` dispatch only. `internal/facts` snapshot types and the key registry. `internal/controls`
schema, strict loader, lint. `internal/check` the pure evaluator — it must never import `os/exec`, `net`
or touch the host (a test enforces it). `internal/waiver` waivers, applied after evaluation. `internal/report`
renderers and the exit code. `controls/` the embedded control set and its fixtures. `collect` is Linux-only
and lives behind build tags.

## Rules that are contracts

- Every fact leaf is an envelope; a status other than `ok` never produces `PASS`. A registered key the
  snapshot lacks is `missing` → `ERROR(missing_fact)`, never `absent_means`.
- Exit codes: `check` any `ERROR` → 2 (unless `--allow-error`), any `FAIL` → 1, else 0; `collect`
  0 complete / 1 partial / 2 none. Changing these breaks other people's CI.
- Same input, same bytes. No `map` reaches the JSON or table renderer.
- Result JSON is stdout and nothing else is; warnings are stderr.
- Control and waiver YAML are decoded strictly; unknown keys are errors.
- Never copy KISA guide text or CIS Benchmark text into any file. `docs/reference/kisa/` holds item
  codes, names, categories, importance and page numbers only. See `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
- Fixtures come from public images or are marked `synthetic: true`; never from an employer or customer host.

## Tests

- Every control has `controls/testdata/<id>/pass-*.json` and `fail-*.json`; the prefix is the expected
  status (`fail-` on a `partial` control expects `WARN`). `_expect` may add `reason_code` and `exit_code`.
- Write the test that drives the caller before the test of the helper. After adding a call site, delete
  the call and confirm the suite goes red; if it stays green, the implementation is tested, not the feature.
- Assert something that differs when the call is gone. Prefer structural assertions to substrings.
- Golden files: `go test ./internal/report -run TestJSON -update`, `-run TestTableGolden -update`,
  `go test ./internal/facts -run TestFactsSchemaGolden -update`. Review the diff before committing a
  regenerated golden; a facts golden change means a `since` entry or a schema version bump.

## Documentation

English canonical, `X.ko.md` pair updated in the same commit. Plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/` are
English-only and deleted once merged. Identifiers, flags and paths stay English on both sides.

## Commits

Personal identity only (pinned in `.git/config`; see `.mailmap`). Never push from an agent session.
